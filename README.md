# API Application

This is a Windows application designed to utilize the API routes for a lab web server (see https://github.com/AustinLanc/full_web_app).

Build and run the application and select the correct tab for the data that is needed. Enter in a batch number and click "Search" to bring up all results. Since this is designed for a specific web application on a local network, it is not really feasible to use this for other purposes. It would better serve as a template or example to use when creating a new one.
